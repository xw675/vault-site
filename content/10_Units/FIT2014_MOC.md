# 📘 FIT2014: Theory of Computation

> [!INFO] Map of Content
> Index for **FIT2014 (Malaysia campus)**. **Domain D — strictly zero code**: formal logic, sets and proof, all LaTeX. Arc: languages → logic/CNF → automata → grammars → Turing machines → NP-completeness. Conventions: $\Sigma$ alphabets, $\varepsilon$ empty word, **CNF is the working form**; W1–2 logic notes are shared dual-unit with [[FIT1058_MOC]].

## 📊 Assessment Map
- **Practical Preparation (5%)** ➔ ongoing weekly prac work — part of the in-semester threshold hurdle.
- **Assignment 1 (10%)** ➔ Regular Expressions + Finite Automata — the W2 logic/CNF + coming automata material.
- **Mid-semester Test (15%)** ➔ everything to ~W6 ⟹ languages, logic, encoding, regex↔automata must be solid EARLY.
- **Assignment 2 (20%)** ➔ Lexical Analysis, Parsing, Computability.
- **Final exam (3h10, 50%)** ➔ whole unit; **the exam is a hurdle AND the in-semester tasks form a threshold hurdle** — no coasting on either half.
- **Reference text** ➔ Sipser (pp. 13–14 strings/languages; §0.3 pp. 17–20 definitions/theorems/proofs; pp. 14–15 and p. 302 for normal forms).
- **LO thread so far** ➔ define and manipulate formal languages; read/write propositional and predicate logic; **encode real problems in CNF** (the recurring assessable skill).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes (key skills per week)

- **W1** ➔ 
	- define $\Sigma$/word/language ($\emptyset \neq \{\varepsilon\}$, $\Sigma^*$, $x^0 = \varepsilon$) 
	- decide EVEN-EVEN / DOUBLEWORD / PALINDROMES membership 
	- one example proves $\exists$, never $\forall$ 
	- truth-table the connectives + prove equivalence via the Boolean laws 
	- DNF from True rows, CNF from False rows 
	- encode problems in CNF + cardinality templates ($m = n - x + 1$ literals, $\binom{n}{m}$ clauses) 
	- quantifier discipline ($\exists{+}\wedge$ / $\forall{+}\Rightarrow$, order, negation)
- **W2** ➔ 
	- pick the proof technique from the claim's shape 
	- prove $A = B$ by double inclusion 
	- phrase the inductive hypothesis correctly + test the smallest step 
	- diagnose faulty inductions and *ex falso* traps 
	- listings prove countable; Cantor diagonalisation proves $\{$languages$\}$ uncountable 
	- read/write regexes ($\mathtt{ab}^* \neq (\mathtt{ab})^*$; $R^*$ includes $\varepsilon$) 
	- find a regex from a description, checking the smallest strings
- **W3** ➔ 
	- define an FA both ways (state diagram + transition table) 
	- trace acceptance + state the language 
	- complement a DFA by swapping Final states (fails for NFAs) 
	- define an NFA (accept iff SOME path) 
	- state Kleene's cycle Regexp → NFA → FA → Regexp 
	- run the three conversions by hand (regex→NFA edge rewriting 
	- NFA→DFA subset construction with $\varepsilon$-closure 
	- FA→regex GNFA state elimination)
- **W4** ➔ 
	- minimise a DFA by colouring (Final/non-Final seed; split when row colour-patterns differ; iterate to fixpoint) 
	- implement an FA from its table 
	- distinguish **pattern** (regex) vs **token** (name) vs **lexeme** (text); lexer conventions **maximal munch** then **first-listed** 
	- prove closure under complement/union/**intersection via De Morgan**/concatenation (subsets & supersets are NOT closed) 
	- state + prove the **Pumping Lemma** from the circuit/pigeonhole argument, quantifiers exact 
	- **prove non-regularity**: choose $w$ so $|x|+|y| \le N$ leaves one case ($\mathtt{a}^N\mathtt{b}^N$), pump up or **down**, or use the closure shortcut (EQUAL $\cap\ \mathtt{a}^*\mathtt{b}^*$ = HALF-AND-HALF)
- **W5** ➔ 
	- define a **CFG** (terminals/nonterminals/productions, start symbol) + read/write **BNF** 
	- give the **language generated**; a **CFL** is what some CFG generates 
	- build a **derivation** and its **parse tree**, distinguish **leftmost/rightmost** (same tree, same length) and use the **prefix property** 
	- **write a grammar** from an inductive definition (Dyck $S\to\varepsilon\mid(S)\mid SS$; PALINDROME; $\mathtt{a}^n\mathtt{b}^n$ via $S\to\mathtt{a}S\mathtt{b}\mid\varepsilon$) 
	- recognise a **regular grammar** (semiword rules) and build one from an NFA ($X\xrightarrow{z}Y \Rightarrow X\to zY$); know **{regular} ⊊ {CFL}** 
	- define a **PDA** (NFA + stack; transition $x,y\to z$ = read/pop/push; $\$$ bottom-marker; accept iff some path reaches Final) and know **CFG ⟺ PDA** (both construction directions), that NFA = stackless PDA, and that **deterministic PDAs are weaker**
