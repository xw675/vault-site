# 📘 FIT2094: Databases

> [!INFO] Map of Content
> Index for **FIT2094 Databases**. Each link below is a standalone atomic note. Start with [[Database Design Life Cycle]] and follow the links. Conceptual modelling uses **Crow's Foot** notation throughout.

## 📊 Assessment Map

- **Written Assignment (70%)** ➔ THE unit: design (ER → logical → normalised) + executable Oracle SQL; fed by Weeks 2–10 and [[Oracle SQL Toolkit (Cheatsheet)]].
- **Test (30%)** ➔ theory: relational model, relational algebra, normalisation reasoning. No exam.

## 🧰 Toolkit Cheatsheets (pinned — pre-lab / pre-exam single re-reads)
- 📌 [[FIT2094 Unit Cheatsheet]] — whole-unit exam crib — design pipeline, normalisation, SQL decision rules, transactions, NoSQL
- [[Oracle SQL Toolkit (Cheatsheet)]] -> integrates Topics 8–9: anatomy, predicates, functions, joins, subqueries + integration katas

	- COUNT(*) vs COUNT(col) 
	- every SELECT column grouped or aggregated
