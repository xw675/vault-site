# 📘 FIT2099: Object-Oriented Design and Implementation

> [!INFO] Map of Content
> Index for **FIT2099 Object-Oriented Design and Implementation** (Java). Domain B: every design note carries a Mermaid `classDiagram`; designs are judged on **Coupling / Cohesion / Extensibility**. Start with [[OOP Building Blocks (Class, Object, Field, Method)]].

## 📊 Assessment Map

- **Assessment:** engine-based Java group project across milestones + individual work *(⚠ splits unverified — fill from unit outline)*.
- **Assessed skills:** design rationale in Coupling/Cohesion/Extensibility terms, UML/Mermaid diagrams, SOLID application, smell → refactor.

## 🧰 Toolkit Cheatsheets (pinned — pre-lab / pre-exam single re-reads)
- 📌 [[FIT2099 Unit Cheatsheet]] — whole-unit exam crib — principles, smells→refactors, contracts, UML rules
- [[Java Toolkit (Cheatsheet)]] — code a class from a blank editor: class anatomy, modifiers, types/`==`-vs-`equals`, collections, inheritance/polymorphism/interfaces/enums, exceptions/DbC/CQS, DI/defensive copying, Factory Method, and the smell→refactoring quick-map.
- [[UML Toolkit (Cheatsheet)]] — draw from a blank page: class-diagram compartments/visibility/**relationship-arrow legend**/multiplicity/stereotypes, sequence-diagram lifelines/messages/activation/fragments, and the domain/activity/use-case/CRC modelling tools (Mermaid syntax throughout).

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

**Unit LOs:** 
1. design with UML (class + interaction diagrams) 
2. judge design quality 
3. implement abstraction/information-hiding/inheritance/polymorphism in Java 
4. refactor + debug 
5. practise with IDEs, UML tools, version control

**Key skills per week:**

- **W1** ➔ 
	- static typing catches errors at compile time 
	- class = blueprint, object = instance 
	- value vs reference semantics 
	- constructors, control flow, arrays 
	- client couples to the interface only *(LO3)*
- **W2** ➔ 
	- private fields + deliberate accessors 
	- static = class-level, final = assign-once (reference ≠ immutable) 
	- draw association vs dependency vs inheritance arrows 
	- DRY / own-your-properties / no magic literals *(LO1–3)*
- **W3** ➔ 
	- program to the collection interface (wrapper types in generics) 
	- runtime type dispatches the override, declared type limits visibility 
	- abstract = never instantiated *(LO3)*
- **W4** ➔ 
	- one `extends`, many `implements` — capability contracts 
	- enums kill magic-number smells with compile-time checks *(LO3)*
- **W5** ➔ 
	- argue every design decision through SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP 
	- principles are guidelines — over-application is its own smell *(LO1–2)*
- **W6** ➔ 
	- inject collaborators from outside (DI beyond DIP) 
	- defensive-copy mutable state at boundaries 
	- write rationale = WHY + alternative + trade-off, never description *(LO1–3, A1)*
- **W7** ➔ 
	- sequence diagram one narrow scenario, concrete classes only, correct message/activation notation *(LO1, A1)*
- **W8** ➔ 
	- precondition breach = client bug (exception), postcondition = supplier bug (assertion) 
	- commands vs queries 
	- Factory Method returns the parent type *(LO2–3)*
- **W9–10** ➔ 
	- recognise smell families as hints not proofs 
	- type-branching → Replace Conditional with Polymorphism 
	- refactor behaviour-preserving under tests, two hats *(LO4)*
- **W11** ➔ 
	- decide as late as responsibly possible (Lean) 
	- take technical debt deliberately + repay by refactoring to better design 
	- explore with CRC cards, split when the card overflows *(LO1, LO5)*
