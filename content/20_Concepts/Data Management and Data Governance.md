# [[Data Management and Data Governance]]

**Context:** [[FIT1043_MOC]] · the **Governance** stage of the [[Data Science Process (Standard Value Chain)|value chain]] · protecting data as an asset · frames [[Privacy, Confidentiality, and Security|privacy]] and [[Data Compliance and Regulations (PDPA, GDPR)|compliance]]

> [!abstract] Quick Revision
> - **🎯 Objective:** manage and govern data as a valuable asset ➔ management = the **internal lifecycle**; governance = **external usage/value**.
> - **📦 Core Components:** management (plans/policies/practices over the lifecycle) | governance (access, protection, compliance, usage).
> - **⚡ Critical Bottleneck:** the exam split — **data management = internal data lifecycle**; **data governance = usage/value with legal & ethical considerations**.

## 📝 Dashboard Blueprint
### 1. Why Manage Data
- **Value** ➔ data is valuable; collection is time-consuming and hard.
- **Scale** ➔ large volumes generated at high growth rate, from **multiple sources** (business docs, **ERP** systems).
- **Continuous** ➔ management changes over time as new technology/services arrive.

### 2. Data Management (internal lifecycle)
- **Definition (DAMA)** ➔ development of **architectures, policies, practices, procedures** to manage the data **lifecycle**.
- **In short** ➔ development/execution/supervision of plans, policies, programs, practices that **control, protect, deliver and enhance the value** of data assets.
- **Strategies** ➔ retention period, access mechanism, archive storage, data format across lifecycle phases; plus **security** risk assessment and mitigation.

### 3. Data Governance (external usage/value)
- **Focus** ➔ narrowly on **access, protection, compliance, and usage** — to bring maximum business benefit.
- **Issues it handles** ➔ how data is organised/protected/accessed; **who** may access which portion (privacy/confidentiality); **who** manages and is **accountable**; policies for **compliance** (GDPR, PDPA).

## ⚖️ Core Decision Matrix
| | Data Management | Data Governance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | internal data **lifecycle** | external **usage / value** |
| **Concern** | store, protect, deliver, enhance value | access, protection, compliance, accountability |
| **Question** | *how do we handle the data?* | *who may use it, and under what rules?* |

> [!NOTE] **Crossover Invariant:** the two are complementary — management runs the lifecycle **inside** the organisation; governance decides **who uses the data and how**, balancing business value against legal/ethical constraints (the "conflicting objectives").

## 🧠 Active Recall
> [!FAQ]- Differentiate data management from data governance (internal vs external perspective).
> > [!SUCCESS]- Answer
> > - **Direct Criterion:** Data management is the management of the internal data **lifecycle** (architectures, policies, practices to control/protect/deliver/enhance value); data governance focuses on **usage** — access, protection, compliance, and accountability — to maximise business value within legal/ethical limits.
> > - **Technical Justification:** **Lifecycle vs value chain** ➔ management is inward (handling the data); governance is outward (who uses it and under what rules).
